# Satisfaction-Survey-Application

You can log in to our project as an Admin or User.
Everyone who registers is defined as a user.

What Users Can Do:

Users have the right to participate in the survey only once (they cannot enter it a second time.) 
After confirming the survey, an automatic message is sent to the user's email address.
Users can see the survey result table and download it in Excel format.

What Admin Can Do:

Admin login information
username:admin
password:1234

The admin can do everything that the user can.
There is no survey entry limitation for admin.
After confirming the survey, an automatic message is sent to the administrator's e-mail address. (for testing)
The admin can update the status of users actively or passively.
Users who are passive cannot log in to the system.
